# react-feed
Decon is a simple React + Tailwind social feed demo with photo/video uploads, likes, and comments. Originally built as a deployment practice project, it hilariously came from a random Twitter DM client request â€” which is rare, since those usually come from Discord. Deployed for $0, but still polished.
